### Welcome to my Github poage ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**fraarici/fraarici** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

I am Francesca Arici and I am an assistant professor in mathematics in the Analysis and Dynamical Systems group at Leiden University.

My research interests are in the field of noncommutative geometry and its interplay with theoretical physics. In particular, I am interested in index theory and its applications to operator algebras, in particular Cuntz--Pimsner algebras, graph C*-algebras and their K-theory.
